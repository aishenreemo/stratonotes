## Editing/viewing your notes
The Stratonotes editor has two modes: source mode and markdown mode. Source mode allows you to edit your notes, while markdown mode sets your note as view-only. To switch between modes, simply click the button to the left.

## Renaming notes and naming convention.
To rename your notes, simply add a header on the first line like this:

> \# Your title goes here...

Keep in mind to always add a header tag! Notes with no set title will have its own unique id as its title by default.
